                Key points to keep in mind while filling the MAT application form are that the fee is non-refundable, and there is no provision for form corrections. So, in case a candidate has made a mistake in the form, they will have to register again and fill a new form by paying the fee again. To take a re-test also, candidates have to fill a fresh MAT application form and pay the fee again.
