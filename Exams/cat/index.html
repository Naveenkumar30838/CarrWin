                The Common Admission Test (CAT) is a national-level management
                aptitude test conducted in India by the Indian Institutes of
                Management (IIMs) for admission to their postgraduate management
                programs (MBA and PGDM) The exam is administered in multiple
                cities across India, and the score is valid for one year.

                  exam, up from 2.5 lakh in 2022.</span
                >
                The CAT score is used by the IIMs and other top management
                institutes in India to shortlist candidates for the next stage
                of the admissions process, which typically includes a written
                aptitude test (WAT), a group discussion (GD), and an interview.
                In addition to the IIMs, the CAT score is also accepted by many
                other top management institutes in India, as well as some
                international business schools. This makes the CAT a valuable
                tool for candidates who are interested in pursuing a management
                degree.
