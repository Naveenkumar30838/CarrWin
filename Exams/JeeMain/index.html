                            The Joint Entrance Examination (Main), commonly known as JEE Main, is an all-India standardized computer-based test for admission to various undergraduate engineering programs(B.E / B.tech) in India. It is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), and other Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). The exam is also an eligibility test for JEE Advanced, which is conducted for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

                        <p class="little-right">This is based on where you passed your Class XII exam. It's not about where you were born or where you live.
                        For example, if you took your 12th-grade exam in Delhi, your state code is Delhi, even if you're originally from somewhere else.
                        If you're studying through NIOS, choose the state where your study center is.
                        If you're an Indian citizen in Nepal or Bhutan, it's based on your passport's permanent address.</p>
